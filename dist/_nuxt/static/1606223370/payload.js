One of the reasons she moved away from working in the social services environment in the UK is because she believed the system was too linear in its approach to helping people with mental health issues and she became increasingly stifled by the working restrictions when helping people so disconnected. Despite not having done her more holistic trainings at the time she knew there was more that could be offered to give these people hope and relief. ",spans:[]},{type:a,text:"You will not experience what she refers to as a 'typical psychotherapeutic approach'. While she is grateful for all of the academic training and work experience she has accumulated in the past 3 decades and will always be grounded in evidence-based practise, she has also, in the past 15 years, developed a more holistic and directive approach to her clinical practise. She will equip you with the necessary tools to manage whatever it is you are challenged by.
